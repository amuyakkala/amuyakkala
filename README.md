### 💡 About Me

Hey there! I’m a passionate **Full Stack Developer** who enjoys building robust, scalable, and meaningful software solutions. From frontend interfaces to backend services and cloud deployments — I love working across the stack to bring ideas to life.

My work is deeply rooted in technologies like **React**, **TypeScript**, **Spring Boot**, **FastAPI**, and **Node.js**. On the cloud side, I'm hands-on with **AWS**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Terraform**, always striving to write clean, secure, and production-ready code.

### 🤖 Lately into AI...

Recently, I've been diving deep into **Artificial Intelligence**, particularly the emerging world of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **agentic workflows**. I'm learning how tools like **LangChain**, **AutoGen**, and **OpenAI APIs** can be combined with full-stack systems to build truly intelligent applications.

This mix of backend development and AI is something I'm incredibly excited about — and I'm constantly learning how to blend the two to create smarter, more adaptive software.
